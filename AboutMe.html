    <p>During my junior year of high school, i joined the Florida National Gaurd as combat engineer. I briefly attended St. Leo University and studied sports manangement. Throughout the years, i took some classes at my local community college in Jacksonville, Florida. In 2010 i deplyed to Doha, Qatar. After mny deployment and 7 year contract ended, i left th army to start working in the manufactoring industry. I dived into some CompTia courses briefly, before i decided i wanted to learn about the development and programming side of information technology.</p>
